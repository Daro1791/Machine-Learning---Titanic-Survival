# Machine-Learning---Titanic-Survival
Let's use machine learning to create models that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.We are going to use the data from Kaggle page (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here we have file train.cvs, which we will use to train the model, and file test.cvs, which we will use to make predictions.
