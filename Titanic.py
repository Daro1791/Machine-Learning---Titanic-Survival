## Random Forest
# Random forests are widely used in practice and achieve very good results on a wide variety of problems.
# One disadvantage of using a single decision tree was that decision trees tend to be prone to overfitting the

# training set, often on the order of tens or hundreds of trees. The idea is that each of the individual trees in a 
# random forest should do reasonably well at predicting the target values in the training set but should also be 
#constructed to be different in some way from the other trees in the forest.

## Support Vector Machines
# So you can see that by defining this concept of margin that sort of quantifies the degree to which the classifier 
# can split the classes into two regions that have some amount of separation between them. We can actually do a search 
# for the classifier that has the maximum margin. This maximum margin classifier is called the Linear Support Vector 
# Machine, also known as an LSVM or a support vector machine with linear kernel.

# Cfloat, default=1.0 Regularization parameter. The strength of the regularization is inversely proportional to C. 
# Must be strictly positive. The penalty is a squared l2 penalty.

# kernel{â€˜linearâ€™, â€˜polyâ€™, â€˜rbfâ€™, â€˜sigmoidâ€™, â€˜precomputedâ€™}, default=â€™rbfâ€™
# Specifies the kernel type to be used in the algorithm. It must be one of â€˜linearâ€™, â€˜polyâ€™, â€˜rbfâ€™, â€˜sigmoidâ€™, 
# â€˜precomputedâ€™ or a callable. If none is given, â€˜rbfâ€™ will be used. If a callable is given it is used to pre-compute
